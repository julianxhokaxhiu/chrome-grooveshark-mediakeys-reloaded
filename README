VERSION: 0.9.1
DESCRIPTION: Enable the mediakeys for Grooveshark

HOW IT WORKS:
As a native desktop application, you just press play/pause button,
prev or next and it will trigger the buttons for the web app :)
Now also working in background (minimize Chrome and forget about it).

Now with two added keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Shift+9/0) to add to favorites/collection.

Enjoy!
